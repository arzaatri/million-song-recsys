# million-song-recsys

Built a recommender system based on user-item pairing in the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). This recommender system using the alternating least-squares algorithm both in PySpark for a distributed implementation, and with lenskit for a local implementation. In addition, we provide a baseline popularity model which can provide recommendations for cold-start users.
